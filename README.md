# About

This repo contains code for analyzing composition in [Recurrent Neural Network Grammars (RNNG)](https://github.com/clab/rnng). It is a follow-up study of my paper [__Assessing Phrasal Representation and Composition in Transformers__](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.emnlp-main.397.pdf), by Lang Yu and Allyson Ettinger.
